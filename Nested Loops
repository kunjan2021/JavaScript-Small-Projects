Nested Loops
***********

Imagine you’re a big-wig programmer for a social media platform! You have been tasked with building a prototype for a mutual followers program. You’ll need two arrays of “friends” from two mock users so that you can extract the names of the followers who exist in both lists. Make a variable called bobsFollowers and set it equal to an array with four strings representing the names of Bob’s friends.



// Write your code below
let bobsFollowers = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
let tinasFollowers = ["a", "b", "e"];
let mutualFollowers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < bobsFollowers.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < tinasFollowers.length; j++) {
    if (bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j]) {
      mutualFollowers.push(bobsFollowers[i]);
    }
  }
}

//console.log(mutualFollowers);
